               <h1 id="text">The Latin American Student Association, also called LASA, was established in 1985 at the Rochester Institute of Technology and functions as an institute organization under the African American Latin American Native American Student Association, or ACA. We provide opportunities for our members to learn, embrace, and share their Latin heritage, while at the same time creating and supporting cultural awareness in a social and familial atmosphere. Membership is open to regularly enrolled undergraduates, graduate students, post-graduates, faculty, and staff. We generally meet bi-weekly, and co-sponsor several events with affiliated organizations.</h1>

				The Latin Rhythm Dance Club at RIT is all about the common latin dances (Salsa, bachata, merenge, etc.). We offer weekly lessons for people who want to learn how to dance, or just want to learn more. And we also have lists of events that happen on and off campus for those who just want more opportunities to dance.</h1>
